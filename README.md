# Mask-Detection-Analysis

Face Mask Detection web applicaion built with Flask, Keras-TensorFlow, OpenCV.
It can be used to detect Face masks in real-time.
It also provides a real-time summary of the percentage of the time mask is worn.

# Mask Detector
A Mask Detector, an algorithm based on deep neural networks that detects people through your camera and write a bounding box around faces, looking if they were masks or not. This is not for security purpose.

# Implementation

1.) You have to install the required packages, you can do it:

 • via pip ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

 • or via conda ``` conda env create -f environment.yml ```

2.) Then install flask and create virtual environment in the code folder you will zip from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjtW-wnXlUY)
(till 3:30)


3.) Once you installed all the required packages you can type in the command line from the root folder:

•  ``` set FLASK_APP=wsgi.py ```

•  ``` set FLASK_ENV=development ```

•  ``` flask run ```

4.) Click on the link that the you will see on the prompt.
